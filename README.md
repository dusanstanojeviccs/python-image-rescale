# Python Image Rescale

This script rescales the images from one folder and it's sub folders to another while replicating the folder structure.

### Configuration

This will support scaling images that either in the path of ```folder_from``` or any of the 1st level sub folders within it. Images are exported to the ```folder_to``` location while the same sub folder structure is being replacated.

The script is setup to scale images from the 'data' directory into the 'data_scalled' directory and was run on the top 10 pictures that came up in Google Image Search when the key word cat was searched.

### Disclamer

All images in the cat directory of this repository were downloaded from the google search page as they were the top 10 results on 27/12/2019, they are just used as examples that the script works as expected and I claim no right for any of the images, I would highly encourage you not to use them without permission from their original authors.
